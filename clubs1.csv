A Kid Again at Ohio State,"The Ohio State A Kid Again Club is a student organization that was created to serve the local Columbus chapter of A Kid Again.

A Kid Again is a national organization that focuses on providing hope, happiness, and healing to families who are raising children with chronic illnesses. Many of these families allocate most of their time and funds to providing treatment for their child, so they don't have many opportunities to enjoy worry-free family fun. The A Kid Again organization sponsors these families on various events such as trips to theme parks, concerts, sporting events, restaurant dinners, and seasonal parties, so that the children of this program can forget their worries for a while and feel like ""a kid again"". In addition, volunteers with the organization dedicate time to easing the pain of these children through hospital visits and other friendly interactions, such as a pen-pal letter exchange. As an extension of the main Columbus chapter, students in the OSU A Kid Again Club focus on serving the Columbus Chapter and on forming our own, campus based, support system for the A Kid Again families.

The chapter accepts new members year round, through an application process. Applicants must submit an application to the Columbus Chapter and pass a background test. The Ohio State club requires annual dues ($15 for first time members and $10 for returning students) to cover club operations. Each member will receive an A Kid Again t-shirt when dues are paid.

Alpha Pi Mu,"History - 
Alpha Pi Mu was the brainchild of James T. French, who in 1949 was a senior industrial Engineering student at Georgia Institute of Technology. Nine students, chosen through their affiliation with the Georgia Tech chapter of Tau Beta Pi, constituted the original membership of Alpha Pi Mu. In 1959, full membership in the Association of College Honor Societies (ACHS) was attained. Alpha Pi Mu's association with ACHS signifies that it is the only nationally recognized industrial engineering honor society. Chapters now exist in almost every major university that possesses an accredited industrial engineering program.
Mission - 
While high academic interests and abilities are required for membership, the society's overall goals are much broader. Its purpose is to:
- Recognize top junior and senior industrial engineering students for their academic achievements
- Increase professional development among members
- Promote networking among faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students
- Have fun!
Membership Opportunities - 
Employment
Companies give added consideration to honor society members who have already demonstrated that they have something extra.

Leadership
Employers look for signs of potential leadership characteristics among the students they interview. Officer positions and the worthwhile projects carried out by the chapter provide excellent opportunities for the acquisition of leadership experience and the satisfaction of accomplishment.

Professional Activities
Progress of the industrial engineering profession is closely linked to the growth and development of the Institute of Industrial Engineers (IIE). Alpha Pi Mu has long had close ties with and has cooperated fully with IIE. These organizations have a number of officers and members who are active in both groups, affording close liaison and mutual help.
Membership Qualifications
Excellence, as demonstrated by scholarship, leadership, integrity and sociability are the chief requirements. The Alpha Pi Mu National Constitution states that only those ranked in the upper one-fifth of the junior class or the upper one-third of the senior class may be considered for membership. Graduate students who have demonstrated exceptional scholarly achievement may, upon nomination by the department head, be considered for membership.

Selected candidates can choose whether or not to join, but are only asked once to join Alpha Pi Mu.","Varies- Members will be given information; 1971 Neil Ave; Columbus, OH 43210;",Application/Selection Process,"Vanek.15.osu.edu, Secretary/Initiation Chair",Fall and Spring Initiation,By invitation only,Yes,Honoraries/Honor Societies

Safety and cleanliness for each and all in our house and community are necessary, attainable, and realistic goals. We are committed to keeping the memory of Stephanie Hummer alive by continuously developing new ways to improve safety in off-campus areas.

"Fitness Aesthetics Club, The","The Primary goal of the Fitness Aesthetics Club is to teach students the easiest and most effortless way to reach their ideal physique and maximize results. This includes minimizing the amount of muscle lost while cutting fat, as well as minimizing the amount of fat gained while building muscle. To do this we will hold a series of sessions in which we will answer questions and provide informal lectures that will teach students the principles behind the workout, the diet, and the fitness strategy, among other things. We only use scientifically sound methods that are supported by research or are consistent with the principles of biochemistry. In addition to this students will have the opportunity to receive training and advice during their workouts. Efficiency is one of our primary tenets, and the basic routine we promote is designed to be integrated into an already busy lifestyle and still yield results in a timely manner. The workouts consist of high intensity lifts that are typically done with relatively heavy weight and low repetition. This is in turn will increase overall strength, help prevent muscle loss, and provide a sufficient amount cardio vascular exercise. Although the routine of each individual student will be guided by what we teach, we will also help students tailor their regiment to fit their personal preference. Above all, we promote safety and using the proper technique to not only prevent injury, but also ensure progress. Although what we teach will undoubtedly increase strength and promote a healthy cardio vascular system, this organization is designed to maximize fitness results, and not athletic or sports oriented results. We focus on giving students the knowledge to be able to control their body composition and look their best, which is not necessarily the same as being able to maximize athletic performance.","Friday, 6:00 PM; 1150 Kinnear Road, Columbus, OH, 43212; Columbus, OH 43210;",Open Membership,greco.41@osu.edu,All year,"No application required, see membership contact",No,Sports and Recreation

These German-language texts include, but are not limited to, those belonging to the most fruitful period of German-language philosophy, ranging roughly from the publication of Immanuel Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason (1781) to the publication of Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations (1951).  During this 170-year period, philosophers such as Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Marx, Frege, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Hilbert, and Wittgenstein published German-language works that continue to have a significant impact on the philosophical community.  Furthermore, many of these texts are so full of German neologisms, or so involved with the study of language itself, that translation of the works proves extremely difficult.  Having an official group will allow members to develop their German-language skills in a philosophical capacity. There is significant interest in this endeavor among students and faculty in both Philosophy and German departments.  For philosophy students/faculty, members are given the chance to work with untranslated material.  This is rarely available in seminars, which tend to focus exclusively on English translations of the works.  For German students/faculty, members are given the chance to engage in philosophical conversation over the texts with philosophy students/faculty and improve their translation skills.  Additionally, the official group will provide its members opportunities to speak with experts in this field, which will further enhance our understanding of the issues in German-language philosophy.

MedFIT,"medFIT is a new student organization that was created through collaboration with the OSU College of Medicine Wellness Team to provide fitness training, nutrition advice, and health education specifically for medical students. As future physicians, medical students should strive to exemplify high standards of health in their personal lives. However, overwhelmed by their studies, medical students often neglect to eat nutritious food and get regular exercise. And oftentimes, when exercise is done, poor knowledge and technique may lead to more injuries rather than health benefits. medFIT’s mission is to connect medical students to all the health and fitness resources already available to all OSU students, and to provide them with personalized and group fitness training, nutrition advice, and health education in order to promote healthy minds and bodies among exemplary future doctors! 

Some of the benefits that medFIT would offer to the medical students include: 

1. Monthly guest lecturer series from sports medicine doctors, athletic trainers, personal trainers, nutritionists, dieticians, and sports psychologists. Some lecture topics we had in mind include: Exercise “myth-busters,” common workout injuries and injury prevention, proper exercise technique and tutorials, importance of core stability, dieting and nutrition, and supplements.

2. Personalized nutrition advice/plans from OSU nutritionists and dieticians

3. Fitness assessments and body fat monitoring/progress tracking

4.Medical student only fitness classes/group cardio boot camps – some taught by OSUCOM students for students; other “special event” classes taught by professional OSU and outside instructors

5.Dance classes both on and off campus

6.One-on-one and group personal training sessions from OSU personal trainers 

7.Buddy-system training - sign-ups coordinated amongst medical students themselves to work out together

8.Community outreach projects to promote health and wellness education in the Columbus school system

Ideally, we would like to foster an interdisciplinary collaboration between the College of Medicine and other departments at OSU including: sports medicine, nutrition, exercise science, dance, athletic training. Through a unified effort, bonded by a common goal, we can all learn from each other and shape the healthy clinicians of tomorrow.

One:Twelve,"Purpose: One:Twelve becomes what the KSA student body wants it to be, and offers a progressive medium for the always changing worlds of design and student culture. As a student collaborative searching for the voice of the Knowlton School of Architecture, One:Twelve is aimed at collecting the provocative ideas and intensities of the School’s environment into a raw, dynamic platform of expression and analysis. Through the sharing of theories, experiences, and culture, One:Twelve becomes the voice of the students across physical and disciplinary boundaries, offering an intimate dialogue between local and even global communities. Much like the built environment of the KSA, One:Twelve is a permanent catalyst for student and faculty interaction. It offers a common platform that weaves between classroom and culture, always looking for new relationships between those that are seemingly separate. The ramps of Knowlton Hall create a multi-level system of balconies, terraces, and platforms that stitch together these varied environments of the School, and give way to the Title of our new student journal. We live and work in Knowlton Hall, a place of constant activity and production with a continually growing culture unique to any other. Yet, despite the rich environment that inspires such a dynamic exchange of ideas and knowledge, the Knowlton School of Architecture lacks a cohesive, formidable student voice that bridges disciplinary boundaries. Although not looking for answers, One:Twelve is constantly asking questions of the environment it directly represents. Through stories, research, investigations, and conversation, One:Twelve shares the dynamics of a constantly evolving culture, creating multiple transparencies in the hopes of facilitating a self-examination of the school, the city, and the profession through creative discourse. Simply stated, the goal of One:Twelve is one that acts as an ever-changing link between the disciplines of Architecture, Landscape Architecture, and City and Regional Planning here at the Knowlton School of Architecture.","Sunday 6 p.m.; 275 West Woodruff Avenue; Columbus, OH 43210;",Open Membership,onetwelveksa@gmail.com,Autumn/Spring,By showing up to meetings they are allowed to join.,No,"Media, Journalism, and Creative Writing, , Academic/College"
