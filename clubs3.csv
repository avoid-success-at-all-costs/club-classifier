Student National Dental Association,"Minority populations in America, namely African American and Hispanic, are growing faster than any other population group. However, this growth has not been witnessed in the number of health professionals in this country, including dental and medical students and faculty.

With these figures in mind, one can begin to understand the current disparities in the health status of minority populations compared with the general populations.  The mission of our group is firmly rooted in the ideals of recruitment, retention, and professional transition with a focus on rights, interest, and welfare of future dental professionals.  Over the years, our prominent organization has risen to the challenges of identifying and representing the concerns of underrepresented minorities in dental schools across the nation.

Women in Medicine,"WIM is dedicated to addressing topics of family, significant others, and work environments that affect both women and men.  Medicine is in a time of flux as the number of female physicians rises in a historically male-dominated profession.  This changing climate provides an opportunity to redefine roles and expectations for the best interest of all physicians, whether female or male.  Our goal is to highlight topics relevant to both genders that are not typically discussed in other settings.  We hope that it will be a valuable resource and educational experience for students to get a better idea of how to coordinate their careers with their personal lives.  It is not aimed at women only, for we strive to attain cohesiveness between the genders and discuss issues that each faces both together and separately.","TBA; 370 West 9th Avenue; Columbus, OH 43210;",Open Membership,Not Listed,Not Listed,Attend meetings,No,"Academic/College, Awareness/Activism"
