Out in Business,"We are an organization created to unify and advocate for all Fisher College of Business (FCOB) students, both undergraduate and graduate, who identify as: gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer, and questioning (“LGBTQ”).

We serve to positively affect the culture of Fisher so that all students feel encouraged to be their authentic selves among fellow students, faculty, and staff.

3.	Partner with FCOB administration to ensure a college-wide commitment of support for LGBTQ applicants to FCOB programs and students currently at FCOB; this partnership is solicited from the Associate Dean for Diversity and Inclusion and the Senior Director of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion Student Services, among others.
